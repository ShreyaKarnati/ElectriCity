    <h1 id="header">Nuclear Energy</h1>

    <div class="energyInfo">
      <p>About 20% of the United Statesâ€™ power comes from nuclear power plants. Currently most nuclear power is generated through fission in which a neutron collides with a uranium particle, releasing energy. Unfortunately, this process results in a lot of radioactive waste which can be harmful for the surrounding humans, flora, and fauna. There are also several records of accidents with nuclear plants, where radioactive material has leaked leading to devastating consequences. One tragically famous example of this is Chernobyl, where radiation was leaked from a power plant in Ukraine into the surrounding neighborhoods causing horrible effects. Recently scientists have been studying fusion, where two atoms join together rather than split, and trying to control it to create usable energy, as fusion tends to generate a lot less radioactive waste than fission.</p>
