    <h1 id="header">Wind Energy</h1>

    <div class="energyInfo">
      <p>Wind farms, placed in strategic locations, can generate large amounts of power for cities with very few drawbacks. In order for a windmill or wind turbine to generate enough power, it must be built in a flat, open area with access to at least 14 mph winds. Wind farms can also be built offshore in the ocean in order to save space. Generally, wind turbines reach around 300 feet in the air!</p><br>
      <p>A couple of drawbacks of wind power are that it messes up the view or that the turbines cause noise pollution. However, these are just minor inconveniences that most people donâ€™t seem to mind. Wind power is also a relatively cheap form of energy, though not as cheap as hydropower.</p>
