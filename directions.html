    <h4 class="homeText">Being a Mayor is a tough job! Part of that job is knowing how much of your budget to allocate to what resources. For each level of the game, you will act as the mayor of a different town and you will be making executive decisions on what types of energy you spend your energy budget on! But it's not just staying within the budget you have to worry about. While playing you also have to keep an eye on the control panel to make sure you are generating enough power for your town and, most importantly, staying within carbon emission limits. Add and remove your choice of energy options in order to power the city and move on to the next level! If you generate enough power, stay within the budget, and stay within the suggested carbon emission levels, you'll earn yourself three medals! The budget for each of the levels is different but the prices of the energy sources will remain the same. Wind turbines for $1,000,000, hydro power for $1,000,000, Solar power for $2,000,000, Nuclear power for $5,000,000, and coal for $600,000. It's a tough job, but we know you can do it! Congratulations on being elected and good luck Mayor!</h4><br>
