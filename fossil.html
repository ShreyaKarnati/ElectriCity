    <h1 id="header">Fossil Fuels</h1>

    <div class="energyInfo">
      <p>One of the most common forms of energy globally, is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels can come in many forms such as coal, natural gas, and oil. Since these have been in use and powering our cities for many years, we know a lot about them and they are our most reliable form of energy. They are also relatively efficient sources of energy. However, these sources are non-renewable and have a very harmful effect on our planet. When fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy, they release carbon dioxide, methane, and other contaminants into the atmosphere. For this reason, countries are trying to make a conscious effort to move away from this form of energy and towards sustainable, greener energy choices that ensure that the world has a brighter future.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Recently there has been an increasing number of campaigns against fossil fuels and mining companies, especially in mining areas near residential sectors. One argument to keep fossil fuel companies is that it provides jobs for people with no academic skills who prefer physical labor. However, as more people are educated and the renewable energy industries start to grow, it is becoming important for these people to adapt in order to have a more successful, brighter future.
