    <h1 id="header">Solar Energy</h1>

    <div class="energyInfo">
      <p>One type of energy that has really become more commonplace over the last decade is solar power. One advantage of solar power is that, unlike wind turbines and turbines for hydro power, solar panels can be placed on top of buildings and do not take up any extra space. However, solar power depends on the constant presence of sunlight and therefore may not be a viable option in places where it gets dark quickly or where the winters are particularly severe. Additionally, buying enough photovoltaic cells to produce enough power for a city can cost a lot of money, making solar power much more effective in powering small devices or smaller areas.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Regardless, many scientists see solar power as our future. Solar power is now cheaper than coal in some parts of the world and significantly reduces carbon emissions by almost 6 billion tons per year. Scientists see solar power increasing dramatically in the next ten years. </p>
