    <h1 id="header">Policies</h1>

    <div class="energyInfo">
      <p>The Department of Energy is a cabinet under the President of the United States that is in charge of policies regarding the regulation and establishment of safety standards for different types of energy. The DOE was initially formed to help oversee the Manhattan Project and address safety concerns, and since has evolved to not only ensure safety in nuclear power plants but also regulate the use of other types of renewable and nonrenewable energy. The EPA or Environmental Protection Agency is another federal entity that deals with energy. It is the executive agency of the United States government that is tasked with establishing regulations to conserve the environment, and as such works to ensure that carbon emissions are curbed and maintained at a manageable level. Both the Department of Energy and the EPA deal with government environmental policy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are many ways in which common people can influence environmental policy. One way is through lobbying. Groups such as The Sierra Club lobby Congress, or attempt to influence members of Congressâ€™ positions on policy by offering them money or votes in return. By joining a lobbying group that you are passionate about, you can help indirectly help influence policy. Another way you can attempt to influence policy is by electing leaders who believe in the same principles as you. In this way, your point of view is reflected in the government. Finally, you can also write letters to your local Congress members in order to make them aware of environmental problems in your area or what you feel they should do about certain situations. </p>
